# "Generic" data processing for Animal Well savegames.  As usual with my
# homegrown frameworks like this, it's a bit janky, but it does the trick.
# It's set up to allow defining fields either in-line with each other
# (in which cas there's no need to pass in an explicit offset), or by
# specifying an absolute offset.  If passed in, the offset is expected to
# be *relative* to the passed-in parent offset.
#
# The most questionable bit of the design (IMO) is that it currently walks
# through an open filehandle as it goes, setting offsets based on current
# position, and parsing the data as the structure's defined by the
# implementing classes.  C'est la vie!  We are at least doing all that on
# an in-memory `io.BytesIO` object, so whatever.
